Train time comlpexity
In terms of Big O we deal with 'd' dimension and for 'n datapoints  
Hence, it is **O(nd)**  

Prediction time complexity:  
In prediction we only see one data point at a time and it has dimension 'd' then it is **O(d)**  
Hence, it is good for low latency applications, i.e. where dimension of data is small.  
  
Space complexity for training: **O(nd+n+d)**  
Space complexity for prediction: **O(d)**
