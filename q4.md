In terms of Big O we compute arg max (yi (w^t xi) + b)  

Train complexity  
Since:  
- w is a vector of size d. Performing the operation yi*w^t*xi takes O(d) steps  
- iterating over n data points  
Hence, it is *O(nd)*  

Prediction complexity:  
In prediction we only need to perform the w^t*xi. As w has dimension d then it is *O(d)*  
Hence, it is good for low latency applications, i.e. where dimension of data is small.  
  
Space complexity for training: *O(nd+n+d)*  
Space complexity for prediction: *O(d)*
